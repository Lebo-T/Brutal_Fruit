I built this site using a bootstrap subtheme to aid in responsiveness,
Even though the site is bootstrap based, I made use of flexbox styling to position items particularly on
desktop version.

For the footer, I made use of custom blocks rather than to add copy changes in twig, this is mainly for a much easier
user experience, user may control what is added solely using the CMS.

Slider banners - Slick module installed to achieve slider functionality.

To compile scss files, use 'gulp sass' command within the theme directory. 

Extensive research and multiple modules have been applied/installed to achieve the basic layout of the site.

Unfortnately there's not many words to describe this site as only a small portion of it has been completed,
this is only due to very limited time constraints.
