To compile scss files, use 'gulp sass' command within the theme directory. 

I built this site using a bootstrap subtheme to aid in responsiveness,
Even though the site is bootstrap based, I made use of flexbox styling to position items particularly on
desktop version.

carousel banners - Owl carousel module was used to achieve simple scroll functionality on main banner, with a separate image added for
mobile version which is set to not display on dektop and tablet devices.

Cards section (incomplete) - fields were added within the landing page for the cards section, to achieve the tiles with different height,
the intention was to use masonary functionality which is available on bootstrap and to alter twig files with classes and layout.

Contact Form - webform module was installed and made use of to achieve the appearance and functionality of the webform. Webform UI
module was also installed to make it much simpler for the user to edit fields within the form.

Slider component (incomplete) - Slick module installed with the intentions to be used for this section as it provides simple
functionality and is user friendly for content editors

For the footer, I made use of custom blocks rather than to add copy changes in twig, this is mainly for a much easier
user experience, user may control what is added solely using the CMS.
